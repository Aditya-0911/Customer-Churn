## Project Overview

Welcome to the Customer Churn Prediction project! This repository contains all the code and resources needed to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques. Churn prediction is a critical task for businesses to identify customers who are likely to stop using their services, allowing them to take proactive measures to retain those customers.

## Data
The data contains 7000 data points each represnting information about the customer. The data set includes information about:
* Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
* Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
* Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
* Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

## Preprocessing
The data is been preprocessed and has been encoded with help of sklearn library to make it suitable to work in Artificial Neural Network (ANN) 

## Models
1. Model 1 Description
   * The model contains 2 hidden layers and one output layer
     1. Layer 1 contains 10 nodes and activation function as ReLU
     2. Layer 2 contains 5 nodes and activation function as ReLU
     3. Output Layer contains 1 node and activation function as Sigmoid
    
   * Model uses Adam optimizer with learing rate of 0.001
   * Model uses Binary_CrossEntropy loss to calculate the loss at every step and metrics is accuracy
   * Model is ran over 100 epochs
   * Model has accuracy of 77.29 % 

   
2. Model 2 Description
   * The model contains 3 hidden layers and one output layer
     1. Layer 1 contains 15 nodes and activation function as ReLU
